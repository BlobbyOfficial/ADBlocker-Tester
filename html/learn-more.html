        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>AdBlocker Tester works by creating fake ad elements in the page using images and content that resemble real online ads. The ads are dynamically generated and inserted at a rapid rate, mimicking real-world ad serving behavior.</p>
        <p>These ads do not lead to real external sites and do not contain any harmful or malicious content. They are purely for testing how well your ad blocker performs.</p>
